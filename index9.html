    <P>Digital transformation is revolutionizing the way businesses approach their operations, product and service
        offerings, marketing efforts and every other facet of their organization. Higher education is one of the biggest
        industries that is well-positioned to derive considerable benefits from digital transformation.</P>

    <h1>How Digital Transformation Relates to Higher Education</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Ultimately, the goal of digital transformation is to better serve customers and streamline business operations.

        In higher education, the customers are the students and they have an immense amount of learning options to
        choose from — private vs. public schools, online vs. on-campus learning and full-time vs. part-time enrollment.

        From 2005 to 2016, the National Center for Education Statistics reports that the number of post-secondary
        institutions in the United States increased by nearly 10%.

        And with more options than ever before, college and university leaders are struggling to maintain a competitive
        edge, which is even more concerning when you take into account the declining rate of high school graduates. As
        Forbes reports, the number of high school graduates has decreased across most of the country every year and
        won’t see an increase until 2024.

        So how can a university keep up? Digital transformation.</p>
